## (ii) Keywords
  * (ii1)**Ajax Applications** : Short for asynchronous JavaScript and XML. With Ajax, web applications can send data to and retrieve from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. 
  * (ii2)**Finite State Machine (FSM)** : It is conceived as an abstract machine that can be in one of a finite number of states. The machine is in only one state at a time; the state it is in at any given time is called the current state. It can change from one state to another when initiated by a triggering event or condition; this is called a transition. A particular FSM is defined by a list of its states, and the triggering condition for each transition.
  * (ii3)**Hill-Climbing Algorithm** : It is an iterative algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution to a problem, then attempts to find a better solution by incrementally changing a single element of the solution. If the change produces a better solution, an incremental change is made to the new solution, repeating until no further improvements can be found.
  * (ii4)**Fitness function**  : A fitness function is a particular type of objective function that is used to summarise, as a single figure of merit, how close a given design solution is to achieving the set aims.

## (iii) Artifacts
* (iii1) **Motivation** : Author's previous work investigated a state-based testing approach, based on semantically interacting events. The main drawback of this approach is that exhaustive generation of semantically interacting event sequences limits quite severely the maximum achievable length, while longer sequences would have higher fault exposing capability. This paper investigates a search-based algorithm for the exploration of the huge space of long interaction sequences, in order to select those that are most promising, based on a measure of test case diversity, on the hill climbing algorithm. 
* (iii2) **2.	Tutorial materials** : Paper proposes a search-based test case derivation technique for Ajax (called HILL), based on the hill climbing algorithm. Paper provides pseudo-code of the algorithm used by HILL to generate the sequences of semantically interacting events composing the final testing suite.

* (iii3) **3.	Data** : Two reusable projects are discussed, which we have submitted  at http://openscience.us/repo/contribute/donate.

    a.	**Tudu Lists** is an Open Source, on-line application for managing todo lists

    b.	**Oryx3** is an academic Open Source project that allows you to add your prototypes to a powerful process modeling infrastructure.

* (iii4) **Related Work** : Several techniques and a few tools have been presented in the literature to support testing of Web applications.

## (iv) Future work:
  * (iv1) Future work will be devoted to the improvement of the FSM algorithm.
  * (iv2) Experiment with alternative search based algorithms and we will apply them to a larger benchmark of Ajax applications.
  * (iv3) Investigate the role of input selection and infeasible paths in the FSM during test case generation.
