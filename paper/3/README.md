ii: Keywords:
------------------
#### ii1: Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE): 
*"Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE) is the name given to a field of research and practice in which computational search (as well as optimisation techniques more usually associated with Operations Research) are used to address problems in Software Engineering"*
#### ii2: Hyper-heuristic search: 
Normal heuristics operate on search space of potential solutions. Hyper Heuristics operate on search space of heuristics.
#### ii3: Self Adaptive software Systems: 
Software systems that have SBSE integrated within the systems that allows them to fix faults and cope with anomalies, provides on-line adaptivity to meet new challenges, environments and platforms.

#### ii1: Motivational statements:
- The main motivation behind this paper is to present a proposal of applying Search based software engineering practices to create self adaptice software systems. The author starts by refereing many examples where SBSE is proved usefull in the past : Requirements optimization, Predictive Modelling,search based testing for Non-Functional Properties, Program Comprehension, search–based software design and search based automated Testing. - The main challenge acording author is following: Although SBSE has been successfully applied in isolation to the above mentioned phases of software development process, there is a need to develop hollistic sbse aproach which can allow all of these techniques to applied in co-ordination. The programmers will not need to devise the serach algorithms for different phases.
- Instead of designing bespoke optimisation algorithms for specific instances, we advocate the design of ‘reasonably good’ hyper heuristic optimisers that have the generality to be applied more readily ‘out of the box’.
- Self-adaptivity has been a goal of software and systems engineering research for some time and author beleives that SBSE will allow to add some value to this grand challenge.

#### ii2: Hypothesis: 
- The athor believes that usin Hyper heuristics seach, we can directly optimise the engineering material: the programs themselves. This means that the software itself will re-balance, re-configure, and even to redevelop itself as it operates.
- Since we have acheived great results in tuning of parameters, re-design aspects of systems to fix bugs using genetic programming, migration to new platforms and languages and optimization of nonfunctional
properties, All this work is early indication of potential for Dynamic Adaptive SBSE.
