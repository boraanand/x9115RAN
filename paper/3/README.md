ii: Keywords:
------------------
#### ii1: Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE): *"Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE) is the name given to a field of research and practice in which computational search (as well as optimisation techniques more usually associated with Operations Research) are used to address problems in Software Engineering"*
#### ii2: Hyper-heuristic search: Normal heuristics operate on search space of potential solutions. Hyper Heuristics operate on search space of heuristics.
#### ii3: Self Adaptive software Systems: Software systems that have SBSE integrated within the systems that allows them to fix faults and cope with anomalies, provides on-line adaptivity to meet new challenges, environments and platforms.
