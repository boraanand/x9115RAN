#### Abstract:
- As a part of this report, we analyze, how Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE) has contributed to debugging, maintenance, and testing of Web/ Mobile applications, and how it has evolved from 2008 to 2015.
- Identifying a software bug and then debugging the software is largely a manual and labor-intensive endeavor, though the process is tool-supported. One objective of SBSE is to automatically identify and fix bugs.
- Genetic programming has been used to search for repairs to programs by altering a few lines of source code. 
- Search-based software engineering has been applied to software testing, including automatic generation of test cases (test data), test case minimization and test case prioritization. Regression testing has also received some attention.

#### Key Words:
- **Search based Software Engineering**:
Is an approach to convert SE problems into optimization problems, which can then be solved by searching optimal solution(s) in the search space.
- **Automatic test generation**: 
Is the process of programmatically creating a set of data for testing the adequacy of new or revised software applications.
- **Hyper-heuristic search**:
Normal heuristics operate on search space of potential solutions. Hyper Heuristics operate on search space of heuristics.
- **Software testing**: 
Is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the product or service under test. Test techniques include the process of executing a program or application with the intent of finding software bugs.
