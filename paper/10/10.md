#### Abstract:
- As a part of this report, we analyze, how Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE) has contributed to debugging, maintenance, and testing of Web/ Mobile applications, and how it has evolved from 2008 to 2015.
- Identifying a software bug and then debugging the software is largely a manual and labor-intensive endeavor, though the process is tool-supported. One objective of SBSE is to automatically identify and fix bugs.
- Genetic programming has been used to search for repairs to programs by altering a few lines of source code. 
- Search-based software engineering has been applied to software testing, including automatic generation of test cases (test data), test case minimization and test case prioritization. Regression testing has also received some attention.

#### Key Words:
- **Search based Software Engineering**:
Is an approach to convert SE problems into optimization problems, which can then be solved by searching optimal solution(s) in the search space.
- **Automatic test generation**: 
Is the process of programmatically creating a set of data for testing the adequacy of new or revised software applications.
- **Hyper-heuristic search**:
Normal heuristics operate on search space of potential solutions. Hyper Heuristics operate on search space of heuristics.
- **Software testing**: 
Is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the product or service under test. Test techniques include the process of executing a program or application with the intent of finding software bugs.

#### Introduction: 
In Search Based Software Engineering, the term ‘search’ is used to refer to the metaheuristic search-based optimisation techniques that are used. SBSE seeks to reformulate Software Engineering problems as search-based optimisation problems (or ‘search problems’ for short). This is not to be confused with textual or hypertextual searching. Rather, for Search Based Software Engineering, a search problem is one in which optimal or near optimal solutions are sought in a search space of candidate solutions, guided by a fitness function that distinguishes between better and worse solutions. 
Interest in search-based approaches in software engineering has been growing rapidly over the past years. Extensive work has been done especially in the field of software testing and related fields.  This survey will cover the branch of software design, where refactoring and modularization have also been taken into account as they are considered as actions of “re-designing” software. Software Engineering often considers problems that involve finding a suitable balance between competing and potentially conflicting goals. There is often a bewilderingly large set of choices and finding good solutions can be hard. For instance, the following is an illustrative list of Software Engineering questions. [3]
1. What is the smallest set of test cases that cover all branches in this program?
2. What is the best way to structure the architecture of this system?
3. What is the set of requirements that balances software development cost and customer satisfaction?
4. What is the best allocation of resources to this software development project?
5. What is the best sequence of refactoring steps to apply to this system?
Answers to these questions might be expected from literature on testing, design, requirements engineering, Software Engineering management and refactoring respectively. It would appear at first sight, that these questions involve different aspects of software engineering, would be covered by different conferences and specialized journals and would have little in common. However, all of these questions are essentially optimisation questions. As such, they are typical of the kinds of problem for which Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE) is well adapted and with which each has been successfully formulated as a search based optimisation problem. That is, as we shall see in this survey, SBSE has been applied to testing design, requirements, project management and refactoring. 

A good indicator of the greatest advantages over other sorbent-based techniques is the number of publications related with SBSE that strongly increased in the last years, and based on our reviews of papers in code 1 - 9, we try to explain the progression of SBSE over the years.
