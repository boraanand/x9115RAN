## (ii) Keywords
  * (ii1)**Automatic test generation** : It the process of programmatically creating a set of data for testing the adequacy of new or revised software applications.
  * (ii2)**Concolic testing** : It is a software verification technique that performs symbolic execution, a classical technique that treats program variables as symbolic variables, along a concrete execution (testing on particular inputs) path. 
  * (ii3)**Symbolic execution** : It is a means of analyzing a program to determine what inputs cause each part of a program to execute.
  * (ii4)**Directed random testing**  : It is a black-box software testing technique where programs are tested by generating random, independent inputs. Results of the output are compared against software specifications to verify that the test output is pass or fail. In case of absence of specifications the exceptions of the language are used which means if an exception arises during test execution then it means there is a fault in the program.
