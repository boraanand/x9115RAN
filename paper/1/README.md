ii: Keywords:
------------------
#### ii1: Search based Software Engineering: 
Is an approach to convert SE problems into optimization problems, which can then be solved by searching optimal solution(s) in the search space. 

#### ii2: Fitness function: 
Fitness function is a formal function used to compare the solutions generated by search algorithm. 

#### ii3: Alternating Variable Method(AVM): 
Is a way of search in which we make changes to one input variable by keeping all the input variables fixed. If mutation to a selected variable  improves fitness value, we try to accelerate change in same direction. The process is repeated for each variable until the optimum solution is achieved or no further improvement is possible.

#### ii4: Static Constant Seeding(SCS) & Dynamically Mined Value(DMV) Seeding: 
* Seeding is used to initialize the input vector in the search process. 
* In Static Constant Seeding(SCS), we initialize the inputs by constants that are derived from the domain knowledge of source code. 
* In DMV, we mine the source code in runtime to generate the values for input vector. Web application contains a lot of information about the input values in the dynamically generated HTML for e.g: valid input might be present as a list of drop down values. We extract these values during runtime to generate the input vector.
