I. Abstract:
------------------
Today, there are many well known optimization algorithms which are used to solve a wide randge of optimization problems.  
Each algorithm is different in the approach and can be better from each other for different models. In this paper, we have    
implemented three types of comparisons- a) between candidate pairs, b) between sets of candidates from the same optimizer,   
c) between sets of candidates from different optimizers.   
We applied three optimization algorithms - Differential Evolution (DE) , MaxWalkSat (MWS) and Simulated Annealing (SA) on  
model DTLZ7( with 2 objectives and 10 decisions) to decide which one is the best for that model.

Keywords: DE, Simualted Anealing, MWS, Type1, Type2, Type3
