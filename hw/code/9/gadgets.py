# GADGETS: Timm's Generic Optimizer Gadgets (and Goodies)

<img width=400 align=right src="../img/gogo.jpg">


`Gadgets` are a library of utilities for working with
optimization models. 

With `Gadgets`, it is possible to encode something
that looks a little like....

```python
for model in [Schaffer,Fonseca,...]:
  for optimizer in [sa,mws...]:
    for _ in xrange(20):
      optimizer(model())
```

Note that:

+ For samples of how to use this code, see [gadgetsok.py](gadgetsok.py).
+ In the following, anything in `this font` is some method or class in the code.

## What are `Gadgets`?

`Gadgets` are a _Factory_ and a _Facade_:

+ In class-based programming, the _factory_ method
  pattern is a _creational pattern_ which uses factory
  methods to deal with the problem of creating
  objects without specifying the exact class of
  object that will be created. This is done by
  creating objects via (e.g.)  calling a factory
  method-- either specified in an interface and
  implemented by child classes.
+ A _facade_ is an object that provides a simplified 
  interface to a larger body of code, such as a class library. A facade can:
   + make a software library easier to use,
     understand and test, since the facade has
     convenient methods for common tasks;
   + make the library more readable, for the same
     reason; 
   + reduce dependencies of outside code on
     the inner workings of a library, since most
     code uses the facade, thus allowing more
     flexibility in developing the system;

`Gadgets` are a _facade_ since, every time I code a new optimizer, its always some mix-and-match of
numerous lower-level facilities. 

+ On Sundays and Wednesdays, I think optimizers should inherit from
`Gadgets`.
+ On every other day, I believe that since not every gadget applies to every optimizer,
its just more flexible and easier to place all those lower-level facilities into a box, and just 
call interface methods to that box.

_Factories_ assemble _parts_. In this code, I know of three kinds of parts:

+ Parts to hold the specific values from one set of
  decisions, objectives and (optionally) some aggregation of the objective
  scores. In the following, these will be called
  + `decs`
  + `objs`
  + `aggregate`
+ Parts for the some _logging code_ that keeps track of the observed `decs` and `objs, aggregate` values.
+ Parts that talk `About` legal values for the `decs` and `objs` and, for `objs` if we want to minimize
  or maximize those scores.

## Parts of the `Gadgets`

### `Candidate`s

`Candidate`s objects have  objectives, decisions and maybe some aggregate value. 
Using a factory method,  we will fill in `Candidate`s with either 

+ The specific values from one set `decs` and `objs, aggregate`;
+ Or, `Log`ging objects that remember what specific values were ever assigned to  `decs` and `objs, aggregate`;
+ Or, `About` objects that defined what are legel values from the specific values  
  (and, for `objs` if we want to minimize
  or maximize those scores)

In the following, I sometimes refer to `Candidate` objects as `can`. For example, the `ok` method
received a `can` and returns true if the current contents of `decs` are valid.

"""        
class Candidate(object):
  def __init__(i,decs=[],objs=[]):
    i.decs,i.objs=decs,objs
    i.aggregate=None
    i.abouts = i.about()
    
  def __repr__(i):
    "Present me in a  string"
    return printer(i,decs=i.decs,
                   objs=i.objs,
                   aggregated=i.aggregate)

  def __getitem__(i,key):
    "Simple way to access decs or objs or aggregates."
    return i.__dict__[key]
  
  def ok(i,can):
    "Maybe overwritten by subclass."
    return True
  
  def about(i):
    """Factory method for return a Candidate full of 
       About objects."""
    assert False,'implemented by subclass'
    
  
  def clone(i,what = lambda _: None):
    """A genetic factory that makes a new  thing
       like receiver, filled in with 'what' objects."""
    j      = object.__new__(i.__class__)
    j.decs = [what(x) for x in i.decs]
    j.objs = [what(x) for x in i.objs]
    j.aggregate = what(i.aggregate)
    j.abouts = i.abouts
    return j
  
  def alongWith(i,j=None):
    "Convenient iterator."
    if j:
      for one,two in zip(i.decs, j.decs):
        yield one,two
      for one,two in zip(i.objs, j.objs):
        yield one,two
      yield i.aggregate, j.aggregate
      
"""

Using the above, we can build a _factory_ method
called `about` that returns what we know `About`
each candidate.

#### Schaffer

One decision, two objectives, zero  constraints.

"""
class Schaffer(Candidate):
  def about(i):
    def f1(can):
      x = can.decs[0]
      return x**2
    def f2(can):
      x = can.decs[0]
      return (x-2)**2
    i.decs = [An("x",   lo = -10**5, hi = 10**5)]
    i.objs = [Less("f1",  maker=f1),
              Less("f2", maker=f2)]
"""

In the above, `An` and `Less` are really `About` objects that define legal ranges for values 
 (and, for `objs` if we want to minimize
  or maximize those scores).

Note also that `f1` and `f2` are nested methods that accepted a `Candidate` object (which,
you will recall, I call `can`s).


#### Fonseca

Three decisions, two objectives, zero constraints.

"""  
class Fonseca(Candidate):
  n=3
  def about(i):
    def f1(can):
      z = sum([(x - 1/sqrt(Fonseca.n))**2 for x in can.decs])

    def f2(can):
      z = sum([(x + 1/sqrt(Fonseca.n))**2 for x in can.decs])
      return 1 - ee**(-1*z)

      return An(x, lo=-4, hi=4)

    i.objs = [Less("f1",  maker=f1),
              Less("f2",  maker=f2)]
"""

Note the use of a list comprehension to create multiple decisions, all with similar properties.
This is handy here and, for more complex models like `ZDT1` with 30 decisions with similar properties,
it is very useful indeed.

#### Kursawe

Three decisions, two objectives,  zero constraints.

    i.decs = [dec(x) for x in range(Kursawe.n)]
    i.objs = [Less("f1",  maker=f1),
              Less("f2",  maker=f2)]
"""

Again, note the use of a list comprehension to create multiple decisions, all with similar properties.

#### Viennet4

Two decisions, three objectives,  three constraints (all codes into the `ok` method).

"""    
class Viennet4(Candidate):

              Less("f3",maker=f3)]
"""

### `Log`ging Objects 

Another kind of part that is assembled into a `Candidate` by a factory methods are
`Log` objects. These  remembers the range of values
seen so far.

Note one small details about these `Log`s:

+ Sometimes we are logging information
  about one run within other runs. So `Log` has an `also` pointer
  which, if non-nil, is another place to repeat the same information. 

"""

  the logged items This will come in handy... later. The code
for keeping _Some_ values is shown below.

### `About` Objects 

The `About` class (and its variants: `Less` and `More`) define our expectation for 
each `Candidate`
values.

If we need a value for a `Candidate`, we call `.maker()`:

+ For decisions,
  this just pulls a value from the known `hi` and `lo` ranges;
+ For objectives,
  call some `maker` function passed over an initialization time.

Note that `About` is a handy place to implement some useful services:

+ Checking if a value is `ok` (in bounds `lo..hi`);
+ `restrain`ing out of bound values back to `lo..hi`;
+ `wrap`ing out of bounds value via modulo;
+ How to compute the distance `fromHell`.

"""
def lt(i,j): return i < j

Note that many of the above will be called many times as we (e.g.) fill in the decisions
of a `can` (e.g. `guess`, `wrap`, `norm`) or its objectives (e.g. `fromHell`).

Note the last method, `bye`. What it is saying that my optimizers
return logs of what was true _before_ the optimizer ran (in the `first`
era) and _after_ the optimizer completed (in the `last` era found by the optimizer).

## Optimizers

Optimizers take (or create) some examples in some `first` era then do 
what they can to produce a new `last` era of better examples.

One detail is that, when assessing _N_ optimizers, they all have to
start at the same baseline (the same `first` era). So these optimizers
accept that baseline as an optional argument.

Note also that all the following:

+ Process a model in `era`s
+ As each era progresses, a log of what was seen is entered into `now`.
+ Between each era, `last` is set to `now` and a new log is created for
  the next `now` to be used in the next era.
+ Optimizers may stop early after a sequence of unpromising `era`s.
+ Optimizers may stop early if we get too close to zero
+ When generating logs, if there is an outer log, store values in this
  log as well as the outer (see the `also` and `also2` parameters).
